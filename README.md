Game Rules:
THE DEAL
The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.

THE PLAY
Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.



HOW TO KEEP SCORE
The game ends when one player has won all the cards.
