Game Rules:
THE DEAL
The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time, face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places their stack of cards face down, in front of them.

THE PLAY
Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.

If the cards are the same value, it's a draw and the next card in the pile is turned over. The winner of the battle takes all cards.

HOW TO KEEP SCORE
Each round won is worth one point. The game ends when a player reaches a score of 15.
