Start with one deck of cards (array .flat .map)
need to shuffle deck of cards and divide into two piles (.random?)
need player and computer to draw one card (add click event)
compare player card and computer card for a winner (if else statements)
winner of that round keeps cards and adds it to deck (going to .push() somewhere)
display winner of round
player who wins all cards in deck determines winner of game **would like to add option to end game early and whoever has most cards in deck is winner if there is time**
display winner of game
